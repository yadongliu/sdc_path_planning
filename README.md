# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Generating Paths

Our goal is to generate a series of x,y points in 0.02 second intervals for the car to follow. In order to smooth out the acceleration and minimize jerk, these points
are generated along a few reference points by using the Spline library. 

So the first step is to calcuate these reference points. In this implementation,
they are generated by either taking the last two points from the car's previous path if known, or taking the car's current position and back-calculating the car's previous position by using the kinetic model. 

```
            vector<double> ptsx;
            vector<double> ptsy;

            // where the car is or previous path end point
            double ref_x = car_x;
            double ref_y = car_y;
            double ref_yaw = deg2rad(car_yaw);
            if(prev_size < 2) {
              // starting: use two points tangent to the car
              double pre_ref_x = car_x - cos(car_yaw);
              double pre_ref_y = car_y + sin(car_yaw);

              ptsx.push_back(pre_ref_x);
              ptsx.push_back(ref_x);
              ptsy.push_back(pre_ref_y);
              ptsy.push_back(ref_y);
            } else {
              // last point from the previous path
              ref_x = previous_path_x[prev_size-1];
              ref_y = previous_path_y[prev_size-1];

              double pre_ref_x = previous_path_x[prev_size-2];
              double pre_ref_y = previous_path_y[prev_size-2];

              ref_yaw = atan2(ref_y - pre_ref_y, ref_x - pre_ref_x);

              ptsx.push_back(pre_ref_x);
              ptsx.push_back(ref_x);
              ptsy.push_back(pre_ref_y);
              ptsy.push_back(ref_y);
            }
```

Next, we will project out 30, 60 and 90 meters along the s direction in the Frenet
coordinate system, in the projected destination lane. But we need to convert the Frenet coordinates to world coordinates by using the utility function getXY(). 

```
            // points ahead of car in 30, 60, 90 meters
            std::vector<double> next_waypoints_0 = getXY(car_s+30.0, (0.5+lane)*4.0, map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
            std::vector<double> next_waypoints_1 = getXY(car_s+60.0, (0.5+lane)*4.0, map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
            std::vector<double> next_waypoints_2 = getXY(car_s+90.0, (0.5+lane)*4.0, map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
            
            ptsx.push_back(next_waypoints_0[0]);
            ptsx.push_back(next_waypoints_1[0]);
            ptsx.push_back(next_waypoints_2[0]);
            ptsy.push_back(next_waypoints_0[1]);
            ptsy.push_back(next_waypoints_1[1]);
            ptsy.push_back(next_waypoints_2[1]);
```

These points are in the world coordinates, to make Spline calculations easier, 
we are going to convert them to the car's local coordinates.

```
            for(int i=0; i<ptsx.size(); i++) {
              double shift_x = ptsx[i] - ref_x;
              double shift_y = ptsy[i] - ref_y;

              ptsx[i] = shift_x * cos(0-ref_yaw) - shift_y * sin(0-ref_yaw);
              ptsy[i] = shift_x * sin(0-ref_yaw) + shift_y * cos(0-ref_yaw);
            }
```

The last few steps are basically to fit a spline curve and create 50 points along
the curve that moves the car in fixed time interval of 0.02 second therefore the
distance interval determines how fast the car moves. And before the path is sent
to the simulator, it is converted from the car's local coordinates back to the 
world coordinates again. 

```
            tk::spline s;
            s.set_points(ptsx, ptsy);

            for(int i=0; i<previous_path_x.size(); i++) {
              next_x_vals.push_back(previous_path_x[i]);
              next_y_vals.push_back(previous_path_y[i]);
            }

            double target_x = 30.0;
            double target_y = s(target_x);
            double target_dist = distance(0.0, 0.0, target_x, target_y);
            double x_add_on = 0.0;
            double N = target_dist / (0.02 * ref_vel / 2.24); 

            for(int i=1; i <= 50 - previous_path_x.size(); i++) {
              double x_point = x_add_on + target_x / N;
              double y_point = s(x_point);
              x_add_on = x_point;
              
              double x_ref = x_point;
              double y_ref = y_point;
              x_point = x_ref * cos(ref_yaw) - y_ref * sin(ref_yaw);
              y_point = x_ref * sin(ref_yaw) + y_ref * cos(ref_yaw);

              x_point += ref_x;
              y_point += ref_y;

              next_x_vals.push_back(x_point);
              next_y_vals.push_back(y_point);
            }
```

As mentioned earlier, we project the path out along the car's next target lane but
didn't spell out how we determine the target lane. That's where the car's sensor 
fusion data come in to help. The car is biased to stay in the center lane (lane number is 1 and the lane center Frenet _d_ coordinate is 6m). The car will change
lanes (first to the left if available, then to the right) if it comes to within 
30 meters of the car infront. Before a lane change is executed, it makes sure there
is enough space for a safe switch over. 



## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
